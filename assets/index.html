          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML attribute defines additional information about an element</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements (like this one)</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML element is the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage</li>

          <li>A margin element indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>

          <li>There are (3) ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Stylesheet, or External CSS Stylesheet</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: when developer wants to style an element directly in HTML file using a "style" attritbute -- useful for a quick and permanent change but less flexible than other two options because each inline style must be edited individually with any design change</li>
          <li>Internal CSS: used to <strong>embed</strong> an entire stylesheet directly in HTML containing CSS rules for webpage in the head section of HTML file the rules apply to that page - can configure</li>
          <li>External CSS: when styling is done completely seperate from HTML code, using < link > within the head of HTML code linking all styling to webpage -- the two code languages kept separate for developer ease</li>
