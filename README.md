## Usage

This project serves as a consolidated reference for the fundamental topics covered in the prework courses before the start of my coding bootcamp. It encompasses key concepts and practical insights into HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It is a culmination of my learning journey, providing a structured overview of the basics. 
The Prework Study Guide was created through hands-on learning, practical exercises, and exploration of various coding concepts. It includes a webpage developed using HTML, styled with CSS, version-controlled using Git, and enhanced with interactive elements using JavaScript. Each section reflects the topics covered in the prework courses, providing explanations, code snippets, and practical examples to reinforce the learning experience.
